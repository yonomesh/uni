import "context"

// Context is a type which defines the lifetime of modules that
// are loaded and provides access to the parent configuration
// that spawned the modules which are loaded. It should be used
// with care and wrapped with derivation functions from the
// standard context package only if you don't need the Caddy
// specific features. These contexts are canceled when the
// lifetime of the modules loaded from it is over.
//
// Use NewContext() to get a valid value (but most modules will
// not actually need to do this).
