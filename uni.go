package uni

// Config is the top (or beginning) of the Uni configuration structure.
//
// Many parts of this config are extensible through the use of Kaze modules.
// Fields which have a json.RawMessage type and which appear as dots (•••) in
// the online docs can be fulfilled by modules in a certain module
// namespace. The docs show which modules can be used in a given place.
//
// Whenever a module is used, its name must be given either inline as part of
// the module, or as the key to the module's value. The docs will make it clear
// which to use.
//
// Generally, all config settings are optional, as it is Kaze convention to
// have good, documented default values. If a parameter is required, the docs
// should say so.
//
// Go programs which are directly building a Config struct value should take
// care to populate the JSON-encodable fields of the struct (i.e. the fields
// with `json` struct tags) if employing the module lifecycle (e.g. Provision
// method calls).
type Config struct{}

// App is a thing that Caddy runs.

	Start() error
	Stop() error
